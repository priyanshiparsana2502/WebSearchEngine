Previous Next ? With AngularJS, you can include HTML from an external file. AngularJS Includes With AngularJS, you can include HTML content using the ng-include directive: Example <body ng-app=""> <div ng-include="'myFile.htm'"></div> </body> Try it Yourself ? Include AngularJS Code The HTML files you include with the ng-include directive, can also contain AngularJS code: myTable.htm: <table> <tr ng-repeat="x in names"> <td>{{ x.Name }}</td> <td>{{ x.Country }}</td> </tr> </table> Include the file "myTable.htm" in your web page, and all AngularJS code will be executed, even the code inside the included file: Example <body> <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="customersCtrl"> <div ng-include="'myTable.htm'"></div> </div> <script> var app = angular.module('myApp', []); app.controller('customersCtrl', function($scope, $http) { $http.get("customers.php").then(function (response) { $scope.names = response.data.records; }); }); </script> Try it Yourself ? Include Cross Domains By default, the ng-include directive does not allow you to include files from other domains. To include files from another domain, you can add a whitelist of legal files and/or domains in the config function of your application: Example: <body ng-app="myApp"> <div ng-include="'https://tryit.w3schools.com/angular_include.php'"></div> <script> var app = angular.module('myApp', []) app.config(function($sceDelegateProvider) { $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([ 'https://tryit.w3schools.com/**' ]); }); </script> </body> Try it Yourself ? Be sure that the server on the destination allows cross domain file access. ? Previous Next ?
