Previous Next ? ? ? ? What are Emojis? Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not. They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) alphabet. UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. The HTML charset Attribute To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page. This is specified in the <meta> tag: <meta charset="UTF-8"> If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML. UTF-8 Characters Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers): A is 65 B is 66 C is 67 Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <body> <p>I will display A B C</p> <p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself ? Example Explained The <meta charset="UTF-8"> element defines the character set. The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67. To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon). Emoij Characters Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet: ? is 128516 ? is 128525 ? is 128151 Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <body> <h1>My First Emoji</h1> <p>&#128512;</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself ? Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML. Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <body> <h1>Sized Emojis</h1> <p style="font-size:48px"> &#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151; </p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself ? Emoji Value ? #128507; ? #128508; ? #128509; ? #128510; ? #128511; ? #128512; ? #128513; ? #128514; ? #128515; ? #128516; ? #128517; For a full list please go to our HTML Emoji Reference. The @charset CSS Rule You can use the CSS @charset rule to specify the character encoding used in a style sheet: Example Set the encoding of the style sheet to Unicode UTF-8: @charset "UTF-8"; Read more about the CSS @charset Rule in our CSS Reference. ?
