Previous Next ? Semantic elements = elements with a meaning. What are Semantic Elements? A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. Semantic Elements in HTML Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer. In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: <article> <aside> <details> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <header> <main> <mark> <nav> <section> <summary> <time> HTML <section> Element The <section> element defines a section in a document. According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading." A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information. Example <section> <h1>WWF</h1> <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is....</p> </section> Try it Yourself ? HTML <article> Element The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site. Examples of where an <article> element can be used: Forum post Blog post Newspaper article Example <article> <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1> <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p> </article> Try it Yourself ? Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa? The<article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. The <section> element defines section in a document. Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot! So, on the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements. You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements. Example for a newspaper: The sport <article> in the sport section, may have a technical section in each <article>. HTML <header> Element The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section. The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content. You can have several <header> elements in one document. The following example defines a header for an article: Example <article> <header> <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1> <p>WWF's mission:</p> </header> <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p> </article> Try it Yourself ? HTML <footer> Element The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section. A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element. A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc. You may have several <footer> elements in one document. Example <footer> <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p> <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com"> someone@example.com</a>.</p> </footer> Try it Yourself ? HTML <nav> Element The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links. Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links. Example <nav> <a href="/html/">HTML</a> | <a href="/css/">CSS</a> | <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> | <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a> </nav> Try it Yourself ? HTML <aside> Element The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar). The <aside> content should be related to the surrounding content. Example <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p> <aside> <h4>Epcot Center</h4> <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p> </aside> Try it Yourself ? HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements An image and a caption can be grouped together in a <figure> element. The purpose of a caption is to add a visual explanation to an image. Example <figure> <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli"> <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption> </figure> Try it Yourself ? The <img> element defines the image, the <figcaption> element defines the caption. Why Semantic Elements? According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."
