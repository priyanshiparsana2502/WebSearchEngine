Previous Next ? HTML DOM allows JavaScript to react to HTML events: Mouse Over Me Click Me Reacting to Events A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element. To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute: onclick= JavaScript Examples of HTML events: When a user clicks the mouse When a web page has loaded When an image has been loaded When the mouse moves over an element When an input field is changed When an HTML form is submitted When a user strokes a key In this example, the content of the <h1> element is changed when a user clicks on it: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1 onclick="this.innerHTML = 'Ooops!'">Click on this text!</h1> </body> </html> Try it Yourself ? In this example, a function is called from the event handler: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1 onclick="changeText(this)">Click on this text!</h1> <script> function changeText(id) { id.innerHTML = "Ooops!"; } </script> </body> </html> Try it Yourself ? HTML Event Attributes To assign events to HTML elements you can use event attributes. Example Assign an onclick event to a button element: <button onclick="displayDate()">Try it</button> Try it Yourself ? In the example above, a function named displayDate will be executed when the button is clicked. Assign Events Using the HTML DOM The HTML DOM allows you to assign events to HTML elements using JavaScript: Example Assign an onclick event to a button element: <script> document.getElementById("myBtn").onclick = displayDate; </script> Try it Yourself ? In the example above, a function named displayDate is assigned to an HTML element with the id="myBtn". The function will be executed when the button is clicked. The onload and onunload Events The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page. The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information. The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies. Example <body onload="checkCookies()"> Try it Yourself ? The onchange Event The onchange event is often used in combination with validation of input fields. Below is an example of how to use the onchange. The upperCase() function will be called when a user changes the content of an input field. Example <input type="text" id="fname" onchange="upperCase()"> Try it Yourself ? The onmouseover and onmouseout Events The onmouseover and onmouseout events can be used to trigger a function when the user mouses over, or out of, an HTML element: Mouse Over Me Try it Yourself ? The onmousedown, onmouseup and onclick Events The onmousedown, onmouseup, and onclick events are all parts of a mouse-click. First when a mouse-button is clicked, the onmousedown event is triggered, then, when the mouse-button is released, the onmouseup event is triggered, finally, when the mouse-click is completed, the onclick event is triggered. Click Me Try it Yourself ? More Examples onmousedown and onmouseup Change an image when a user holds down the mouse button. onload Display an alert box when the page has finished loading. onfocus Change the background-color of an input field when it gets focus. Mouse Events Change the color of an element when the cursor moves over it. HTML DOM Event Object Reference For a list of all HTML DOM events, look at our complete HTML DOM Event Object Reference. ?
