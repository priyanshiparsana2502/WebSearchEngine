Previous Next ? AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects. AngularJS Controllers AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers. The ng-controller directive defines the application controller. A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor. AngularJS Example <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl"> First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br> Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br> <br> Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}} </div> <script> var app = angular.module('myApp', []); app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) { $scope.firstName = "John"; $scope.lastName = "Doe"; }); </script> Try it Yourself ? Application explained: The AngularJS application is defined by ng-app="myApp". The application runs inside the <div>. The ng-controller="myCtrl" attribute is an AngularJS directive. It defines a controller. The myCtrl function is a JavaScript function. AngularJS will invoke the controller with a $scope object. In AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions). The controller creates two properties (variables) in the scope (firstName and lastName). The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties (firstName and lastName). Controller Methods The example above demonstrated a controller object with two properties: lastName and firstName. A controller can also have methods (variables as functions): AngularJS Example <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="personCtrl"> First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br> Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br> <br> Full Name: {{fullName()}} </div> <script> var app = angular.module('myApp', []); app.controller('personCtrl', function($scope) { $scope.firstName = "John"; $scope.lastName = "Doe"; $scope.fullName = function() { return $scope.firstName + " " + $scope.lastName; }; }); </script> Try it Yourself ? Controllers In External Files In larger applications, it is common to store controllers in external files. Just copy the code between the <script> tags into an external file named personController.js: AngularJS Example <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="personCtrl"> First Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"><br> Last Name: <input type="text" ng-model="lastName"><br> <br> Full Name: {{fullName()}} </div> <script src="personController.js"></script> Try it Yourself ? Another Example For the next example we will create a new controller file: angular.module('myApp', []).controller('namesCtrl', function($scope) { $scope.names = [ {name:'Jani',country:'Norway'}, {name:'Hege',country:'Sweden'}, {name:'Kai',country:'Denmark'} ]; }); Save the file as namesController.js: And then use the controller file in an application: AngularJS Example <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="namesCtrl"> <ul> <li ng-repeat="x in names"> {{ x.name + ', ' + x.country }} </li> </ul> </div> <script src="namesController.js"></script> Try it Yourself ? ?
