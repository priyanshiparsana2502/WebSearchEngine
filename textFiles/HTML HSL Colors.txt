Previous Next ? HSL Value In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white Experiment by mixing the HSL values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(240, 100%, 50%) hsl(147, 50%, 47%) hsl(300, 76%, 72%) hsl(39, 100%, 50%) hsl(248, 53%, 58%) Try it Yourself ? Saturation Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. 100% is pure color, no shades of gray 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. 0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color. Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 80%, 50%) hsl(0, 60%, 50%) hsl(0, 40%, 50%) hsl(0, 20%, 50%) hsl(0, 0%, 50%) Try it Yourself ? Lightness The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white). Example hsl(0, 100%, 0%) hsl(0, 100%, 25%) hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 100%, 75%) hsl(0, 100%, 90%) hsl(0, 100%, 100%) Try it Yourself ? Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades: Example hsl(0, 0%, 0%) hsl(0, 0%, 24%) hsl(0, 0%, 47%) hsl(0, 0%, 71%) hsl(0, 0%, 94%) hsl(0, 0%, 100%) Try it Yourself ? HSLA Value HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all): Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% ALPHA 0.5 Example hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1) Try it Yourself ? ?
